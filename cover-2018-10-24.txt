To whom it may concern,

I wish to submit "Ten Quick Tips for Creating an Effective Lesson" to PLOS Computational Biology's "quick tips" section.  I originally submitted it to your "ten simple rules" section (PCOMPBIOL-D-18-01663), but Francis Ouellette has suggested that I redirect it.

Thank you for your consideration; I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Greg Wilson
