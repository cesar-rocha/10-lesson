\section*{Introduction}

There are many kinds of lessons, both formal and informal, from seconds long to lifelong.
Most people have sat (or suffered) through hundreds of these,
but have never been shown how to design ones that are effective.
These ten simple rules for creating lessons are:

\begin{itemize}

\item based on current educational research \cite{Nuth2007,Ambr2010,Brow2018},

\item filtered by what can be done by non-specialists
  with limited time and resources \cite{Hust2012,Lang2016,Rice2018},
  and

\item prioritized by experience teaching and training people to teach together
  \cite{Deve2018,Wils2016,Wils2018}.

\end{itemize}

\rulemajor{Use Learner Personas to Define Your Audience}

The first step in creating a good lesson is figuring out who the audience is.
One way to do this is to make up biographies of two or three target learners.
This technique is borrowed from user interface designers, who create short
profiles of typical users to help them think about their audience, and the
profiles themselves are called \emph{personas}.

Learner personas have five parts:

\begin{enumerate}

\item the person's general background,

\item what they already know,

\item what \emph{they} think they want to do (as opposed to what someone who
  already understands the subject thinks),

\item how the lesson will help them, and

\item any special needs they might have.

\end{enumerate}

A learner persona for a weekend introduction to programming aimed at college
students might be:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Jorge has just moved from Costa Rica to Canada to study agricultural
  engineering. He has joined the college soccer team, and is looking forward to
  learning how to play ice hockey.

\item Other than using Excel, Word, and the Internet, Jorge's most significant
  previous experience with computers is helping his sister build a WordPress
  site for the family business back home in Costa Rica.

\item Jorge needs to measure properties of soil from nearby farms using a
  handheld device that sends logs in a text format to his computer.  Right now,
  Jorge has to open each file in Excel, crop the first and last points, and
  calculate an average.

\item This workshop will show Jorge how to write a little Python program to read
  the data, select the right values from each file, and calculate the required
  statistics.

\item Jorge can read English well, but still struggles sometimes to keep up with
  spoken conversation (especially if it involves a lot of new jargon).

\end{enumerate}
  
Rather than writing new personas for every lesson or course, instructors often
create and share a handful that cover everyone they hope to teach, then pick a
few from that set to describe who particular material is intended for.  Used
this way, personas become a convenient shorthand for design issues: when
speaking with each other, teachers can say, "Would Jorge understand why we're
doing this?" or, "What installation problems would Jorge face?"

Personas help you remember one of the most important rules of teaching:
\emph{you are not your learners}.  The people you teach will almost always have
different backgrounds, different capabilities, and different ambitions than you;
personas help you keep your lessons focused on what they need rather than on
what your younger self might have wanted.

\rulemajor{Encourage Effective Learning Strategies}

Some learning strategies are provably more effective than others \cite{Rohr2015,Kang2016,Miya2018},
so lessons should be designed to encourage their use.
As summarized in \cite{Wein2018a,Wein2018b},
the six most important are:

\begin{description}

\item[Spaced Practice:] Ten hours of study spread out over five days is more
  effective than two five-hour days, and far better than one ten-hour day. You
  should therefore create lessons and exercises that include some older material
  in each new lesson.  According to \cite{Mill2016}, ``The lectures that
  predominate in face-to-face courses are relatively ineffective ways to teach,
  but they probably contribute to spacing material over time, because they
  unfold in a set schedule over time.  In contrast, depending on how the courses
  are set up, online students can sometimes avoid exposure to material
  altogether until an assignment is nigh.''

\item[Retrieval Practice:] Researchers now believe that the limiting factor for
  long-term memory is not retention (what is stored), but recall (what can be
  accessed).  Recall of specific information improves with practice, so outcomes
  in real situations can be improved by taking practice tests or summarizing the
  details of a topic from memory and then checking what was and wasn't
  remembered. For example, \cite{Karp2008} found that repeated testing improved
  recall of word lists from 35\% to 80\%.

  One powerful finding in learning research is the \emph{hypercorrection effect}
  \cite{Metc2016}. Most people don't like to be told they're wrong, so it's
  reasonable to assume that the more confident someone is that the answer
  they've given in a test is correct, the harder it is to change their mind if
  they were actually wrong. However, it turns out that the opposite is true: the
  more confident someone is that they were right, the more likely they are not
  to repeat the error if they are corrected.

\item[Interleaving:] One way to space retrieval practice is to interleave study
  of different topics: instead of mastering one subject, then the next, then a
  third, shuffle the order. Even better, switch up the order: A-B-C-B-A-C is
  better than A-B-C-A-B-C, which in turn is better than A-A-B-B-C-C
  \cite{Rohr2015}. This is effective because interleaving fosters creation of
  more links between different topics, which in turn increases retention and
  recall.

\item[Elaboration:] Having learners explain things to themselves as they go
  along improves understanding and recall. One way to do this is to follow up
  each answer on a practice quiz with an explanation of why that answer is
  correct, or conversely with an explanation of why some other plausible answer
  isn't. Another is to have learners explain how a new idea is similar to or
  different from one they have seen previously.

\item[Concrete Examples:] One specific form of elaboration that is useful enough
  to deserve its own heading is the use of concrete examples.  As discussed in
  the rule on concreteness fading, every statement of a general principle should
  be accompanied by one or more examples of its use, or conversely take each
  particular problem and list the general principles it
  embodies. \cite{Raws2014} found that interleaving examples and definitions
  made it more likely that learners would remember the latter correctly.

  Another approach is to teach by contrast, i.e., to show learners what a
  solution is \emph{not}, or what kind of problem a technique \emph{won't}
  solve. For example, when showing children how to simplify fractions, it's
  important to give them a few like 5/7 that can't be simplified so that they
  don't become frustrated looking for answers that don't exist.

\item[Dual Coding:] Different subsystems in our brains handle and store
  linguistic and visual information, and if complementary information is
  presented through both channels, then they can reinforce one another. However,
  learning is more effective when the same information is \emph{not} presented
  simultaneously in two different channels \cite{Maye2003,Maye2009}, because then
  the brain has to expend effort to check the channels against each other.
