Response to all reviewers:

Thank you very much for your feedback - I appreciate your help making this paper
stronger.  As well as replacing the Python example with some high school
algebra, I have also rewritten the conclusion, as I am less sanguine about the
use of Git for lessons than I was a year ago.

Best regards,
Greg Wilson

Responses to Reviewer #1:

1.  I agree that it's very difficult to incorporate aspects of many different
    learners into a single persona; this is why I recommend creating personas
    (plural).  I also agree that it's worth spending time reading biographies of
    actual learners if they're available, but (a) they may not be, and (b) they
    often aren't before the lesson is delivered for the first time.

2.  "Having learners explain things to themselves _and others_" - thank you,
    this has been incorporated.

3.  Example of dual coding: the following has been added:

    This is one of the many reasons that reading slides verbatim is ineffective:
    not only is the reader not adding value, they are actually adding to the
    load on learners whose brains are trying to check that the spoken and
    written inputs are consistent.

4.  Regarding summative assessment and lesson goals, the wording has been
    changed to:

    a much better way to set the goal for that lesson would be to define an
    exercise such as:

5.  I agree the sentence was unclear; it has been changed to:

    If the intended learners are not yet that experienced, this exercise could
    be extended to have them make some sort of judgment based on the regression
    coefficients to exercise higher-order thinking.

6.  The use of "that" is deliberate - in my experience, breaking things down
    this way almost always shows that the lesson author is trying to do too
    much.

7.  I do not understand what is meant by a "class example".

8.  Reference to personas removed (seems redundant on re-reading).

9.  Python example replaced - thank you.

10. The summary of Lachney's work has been rewritten - I hope the new version is
    clearer.  I have also moved the discussion of deficit model to be nearer the
    start of the section.

11. I chose not to stress formal learning objectives because I have not found
    them as helpful at the level of individual teachers developing specific
    lessons as the other topics included.  I agree that they are very important
    when working at a larger scale (e.g., integrating lessons into larger
    programs or checking conformance with curriculum guidelines).

12. I chose not to mention the KSA framework because I feel the reverse design
    process is more actionable for most teachers.

Responses to Reviewer #2:

1.  The Python example has been replaced with one that I hope will be more
    accessible to this journal's audience - feedback would be appreciated.

2.  Thank you for spotting the forward reference - I've added a reference to the
    rule's name.

Responses to Reviewer #3:

Thank you very much for the re-wording - it has been included along with a
forward reference to the appropriate rules.
